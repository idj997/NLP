# NLP

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and projects. It covers foundational NLP methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for part-of-speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition using RNN-CRF models, distributional semantics, and text categorization using scikit-learn. The notebooks provide hands-on examples and implementations using Python to help learners grasp core NLP concepts and algorithms. Ideal for students and practitioners looking to build practical skills in computational linguistics, sequence modeling, and text analysis.

## Contents

- **HMM_POS_tagger.ipynb** — Implementation of a Hidden Markov Model-based POS tagger.
- **NER_RNNCRF.ipynb** — Named Entity Recognition using recurrent neural networks combined with CRFs.
- **NLP_Assignment_1.ipynb** — Introductory tasks and exercises in NLP fundamentals.
- **NLP_Assignment_2_distributional_semantics-Copy1.ipynb** — Exploring word embeddings and semantic representations.
- **Unit_2_text_categorization_sklearn.ipynb** — Text classification using traditional ML models.
- Additional notebooks for dictionary-based tasks, sentiment analysis datasets, and other NLP themes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common NLP libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `torch`, and `tensorflow` (depending on the notebook)

### Installation

Install required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk torch tensorflow jupyter
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
